            <td><p>Like Mahatma Gandhi, African leader Nelson Mandela battled against the oppression of the South African people by whites. 
                He received a legal lawyer education. However, he joined the African National Congress and dedicated himself to the goal of 
                achieving equality among all Africans—white and black—by fighting against the policy of apartheid, or the segregation of the 
                black native Africans from all positions of power and privilege. Instead of living comfortably and in luxury as a successful 
                lawyer, he did the opposite. Mandela was sentenced to life in jail by the reactionary South African government in 1962.
                Mandela was finally released from jail on February 11, 1990, after 27 years and 9 months of imprisonment, as a result of other
                African National Congress leaders’ ongoing fight for freedom. Nelson Mandela became the first black African to hold the office 
                of President of the Republic of South Africa when the African National Congress won the general election on the basis of the
                universal adult franchise that had been implemented by the administration of President F.D.H. Clarke.Mandela’s greatness stems
                not only from his success in convincing the white South African government to abolish the hateful and inhuman apartheid, but 
                also from his inspiring call to blacks not to seek vengeance on whites for past acts of tyranny, injustice, and exploitation.

                 <p>Brilliant scientists have come and gone, but perhaps none have accomplished anything under the circumstances that Stephen Hawking
                  has faced. When Hawking was 21, he was in his third year at Oxford when he was diagnosed with a severe Motor Neurone disease that 
                  broke his nerve cells and atrophied his muscles. His words became slurred. Other communication organs were also destroyed. 
                  Doctors only gave Hawking two more years to live. Despite this bleak prognosis, Hawking not only completed his course at Oxford,
                  but also went on to complete his PhD thesis, marry, and have three children. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974,
                  a rare honour for any scientist.Hawking contracted pneumonia again during a research trip to Switzerland, and his windpipe was
                  operated on. This resulted in a total loss of speech. ‘A Brief History of Time’ and ‘The Universe in a Nutshell’ are two books
                  that popularised his epoch-making theories about the Creation and the Universe. Academic honours have been bestowed upon Hawking,
                  who is widely regarded as the greatest physicist and mathematician since Einstein. Stephen Hawking has demonstrated how the human 
                  intellect and spirit can overcome the most severe physical handicaps.</p>

                <p>Machines are at the heart of modern civilization. Machines require a constant supply of energy to function day in and day out, 
                    or they will come to a halt. Our transportation systems—diesel-powered railways, steamships, automobiles, and aeroplanes—constantly
                    require natural fuel to function. Many human efforts have been expended over the last three centuries in search of energy sources—coal, petroleum, and water-generated power—that will allow civilization to continue unabated.
                    Not only that but as the world’s population grows, so will the demand for energy. However, there is a genuine concern that the 
                    world’s reserves of petroleum, coal, and hydropower are gradually depleting. That is why new and unconventional energy sources 
                    such as nuclear and solar energy must be developed. While advanced countries in America and Europe have the wealth and
                    scientific know-how to commercialise solar and nuclear energy, poorer Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh
                    may develop an energy source through bio-gas-producing machines. But the point is that research into the development of new
                    energy sources must be expanded and accelerated.

                <p>The computer is one of modern science’s marvels. Its origins can be traced back to the mechanical calculating machine invented 
                    in 1834 by Charles Babbage, an English mathematician. Because of the lack of engineering skill at the time, the machine was 
                    unable to fully realise Babbage’s vision. Computers today are electronic. A computer can operate at high speeds because it is
                    powered by a small current of electricity. It can perform calculations on very large numbers in a very short period of time using
                    stored information and data. A computer can add, subtract, multiply, and divide large numbers in seconds. Even an expert
                     mathematician would take much longer to complete such calculations. Computers are now widely used in all advanced countries for
                     data processing, which includes fact compilation, correlation, and selection. The use of computers is increasing in all fields
                     of research, industry, and business. Computers have numerous advantages. They save time, speed up work, save labour, and reduce
                    costs in the long run. They are used in educational institutions, industries, research laboratories, government departments, and 
                    so on in all advanced countries.</p>

                <p>It is impossible to imagine modern life without newspapers. A newspaper is a reliable source of important news from both the 
                    United States and around the world. It represents the world’s current and living history. Newspapers are classified into daily, 
                    weekly, biweekly, and monthly publications. A daily paper’s main function is to publish news of general interest, whereas the 
                    others mostly contain literary pieces and articles on important topics. Every newspaper nowadays has some special sections 
                    dealing with politics, everyday problems, unusual news, business, sports, editorial pages, feature pages, and so on. As a result,
                    the newspaper is one of the most powerful organs for spreading news and opinions to the general public. It is crucial in
                    educating people and directing them in the right direction. It is capable of successfully combating social evil if it so 
                    desires. A newspaper can also be very harmful. When used incorrectly, it can breed hatred and enmity between men, sections,
                    and nations. Sometimes it publishes baseless reports or stories to deliberately create confusion in the minds of gullible people.
                    Newspapers are as powerful as any powerful weapon. It can be used for both good and evil. A lot depends on the attitude and 
                    intentions of the people at the top of the paper.</p>
